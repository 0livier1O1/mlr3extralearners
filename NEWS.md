# mlr3extralearners 0.1.1

* Patch for bugs in `surv` learners that were reversing the order of `crank`, see this issue for full details: https://github.com/mlr-org/mlr3proba/issues/165
* `surv.coxboost` and `surv.coxboost_cv` can now only handle `integer` and `numeric` feature types, previous automated internal coercions were inconsistent with mlr3 design.
